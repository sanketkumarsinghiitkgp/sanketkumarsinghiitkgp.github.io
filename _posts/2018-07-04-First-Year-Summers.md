title: How I spent my summers
---

An eventful first year at IIT Kharagpur had come to an end on 28-04-2018. I was supposed to stay back in the college for a month as I was a member of the the software team of AGV(Autonomous Ground Vehicle), and IGVC(Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition) was to take place on June 3rd, 2018.

## May

I spent most of this month in college. At AGV I was mostly involved with computer vision and path planning related tasks. The details of my work at AGV can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/157v_o3XNV1KcUrWUtoz1iK3eEdYfzYJh3VU6ggDDJ4k/edit?usp=sharing).

Apart from this, I completed the Machine Learning course by Andrew NG, Intro to Machine Learning by udacity(almost), Intro to Computer Vision(till module 4), and started the Deep Learning specialization on coursera by Andrew NG. I also started some competitive programming, just to get my feet wet. It was around this time that I wrote my [first post](https://sanketkumarsinghiitkgp.github.io/2018/05/21/Timed-Elastic-Bands.html) for this blog( on timed elastic bands)  . I had come back home on 25th May. I was extremely tired after a gruelling month in the sweltering summer of Kharagpur. I slept through the rest of the month.

## June

I continued with the Deep Learning specialization. I completed two courses of the specialization, when a senior suggested that I start CS231n(Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition) by Stanford University. I decided to put off Deep Learning till 25th June. I learnt some basic shell scripting to help me with tasks like moving files from different parts of a dataset into the same folder without any conflicts in names etc. I also decided to dabble in some web development as I was a complete noob there. I learnt some basic html and then css from codecademy. Then I learnt some vanilla javascript from codecademy. I wrote a blog about [arrow functions in Javascript](https://sanketkumarsinghiitkgp.github.io/2018/06/15/Arrow-functions-and-lexical-binding.html). I solved a bunch of standard questions on dynamic programming, graphs, and string algorithms. I wrote a blog post on a *sort of* rare approach for [pallindrome detection](https://sanketkumarsinghiitkgp.github.io/2018/06/23/Rabin-Karp-for-palindrome-detection.html). I started CS231n. I devoted a lot of time to solving the assignments of CS231n without referring to the solution as far as possible.

## July

I continued watching the lectures and solving the assignments of CS231n. Solving the second assignment was particularly painstaking but very rewarding. It entailed implementing a CNN with a bunch of features from scratch using numpy. I solved the last assignment uptil Neural Style transfer. I trained a Haar cascade classifier for bumper sign detection.
